### squarecircle

Write a program that draws one square and one circle next to each other.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __squarecircle.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-08-for/__
* setup an html file
* create a canvas element of at least 300 by 300
* add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* draw one square of any dimensions
* draw one circle of any dimensions

### radius

Write a program that asks for a number.  It will draw a circle with that radius.

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __radius.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-08-for/__
* setup an html file
* create a canvas element of at least 300 by 300
* add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* the program should ask for a radius: "Give me a radius"
* use the parseInt function to convert input from a string to a number
* the program should use the input to draw a circle with that radius

<hr>

### five

Draw five squares using a for loop

* using SublimeText, create a new file called __five.html__ in your repository directory: __~/Desktop/jversoza/lab-08-for/__
* setup an html file
* create a canvas element of at least 300 by 300
* add script tags... start writing your JavaScript between the script tags
* draw five squares, each below the other (creating a vertical line of squares)
* (optional) \*ask for a number, draw that many squares
* (optional) \*alternate between squares and circles 
	* hint: use a conditional for this
	* hint: use modulo to switch between circles and squares (% 2 will give back 0 or 1)
